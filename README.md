# Overview


C++ is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Most of the major companies that use programming in their companies use C++. This is one of the reasons why I wanted to learn about C++ and see how it can run compared to other programming languages. I wanted to have some background in one of the most popular programming languages.

This C++ program, when ran, will do basic and some advanced arithmetic. The user chooses one of the 7 options and they input the number they are wanting to calculate. The program will then output the answer.

The Software that I used to program and demonstrate C++ is Visual Studio Code. It is a code editor that holds a lot of programming languages. There are a lot of people that use this software to code and do their job.
